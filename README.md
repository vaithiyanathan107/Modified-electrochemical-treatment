electro chemical treatment to remove the total dissolved solvents from the surface water


kaleeswari plant has a system to use  underground water for generating steam with boilers, as the surface water was having a dissolved components like TDS ,COD ,BOD which was leading for formation of strains,scales in system , which was disrupting the heat transfer,

As a solution ,they were using a reverse osmosis system to overcome this issue, we used modified electro chemcial treatment which is feasible and very much cost efficient for the company .
